## Recruitment diagnostics

The recruitment diagnostics below contain (1) boxplots by scenario for standardized residuals aggregated across (a) number of streams sampled and (b) proportions of weirs sampled; and (2) a random selection of four sets of stock recruitment data and subsequent expected recruitment for both the number of streams and the proportion of weirs separated out by scenario.


```{r results = 'hide', echo = FALSE}
print(recStats$boxNStock)
print(recStats$boxNWeir)
lapply(recStats$weirRecPlot, print)
```
